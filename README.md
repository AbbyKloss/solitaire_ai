# Solitaire AI
## For CSE 6633 - Intro to AI

Uses Selenium to automatically play a game on [freesolitaire.win](https://www.freesolitaire.win). The goal is to use heuristics to play this game, but they are not implemented at the time of writing.

### How to Install
1. Requires an Anaconda installation, I recommend [Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install)
1. Once that's installed, run `conda env create -f env.yml` while in this directory to create the conda environment for this project
1. run `conda activate solitaire_ai`
1. run `python main.py`

and you've got a solitaire game going!
